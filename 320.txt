I am interested in 320 because I want to learn more about data science and the methods that people use to analize data. I think that there are a lot of important things in the world that revolve around being able to do large scale data analysis, and by being able to understand and practice these methods myself I can be more knowledgable and do my own work to develop my own insights as well.
